# Stopwatch Timer
A basic timer written in JS that can play and pause. From the Colt Steele Modern JS Course on Udemy.

## Things I Learned
* Implementing an event-based architecture to watch when the timer stops, starts, and resets
* Used a class-based implementation and a DOM-centric approach to build a Timer class that tracks when the timer stops, starts, and resets
* Used SVGs and basic CSS animations and linked its duration to the timer length so that it always ends when the timer ends

## To-Do List
- [ ] Recreate Timer as a React-based component
- [ ] Add sound when timer finishes
- [ ] Add a reset button to reset the timer at the last chosen timer length
- [ ] \(Optional) Add a color theme picker to change the styling to the timer
